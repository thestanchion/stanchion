I really wanted it to work for Ruben Amorim. I really, really did. He came to us with a short but strong CV from Sporting, although maybe we should have seen that success in Portugal doesn't always equate to success in England. There have been a few notable success stories: Mourinho being the standout, and Nuno having a massive impact when he first came to Wolves.

We got sucked into the trend of going for a young European manager. There seem to be a lot of them around at the moment from Hurzeler and De Zerbi to Iraola. Mikel Arteta is still only 43, although he had been coaching here for a period of time before getting the Arsenal job.
    
We also seemed really set on the fat that he is a system manager. Amorim was - and still is - steadfastly wedded to his 3-4-2-1 system, and we were so desperate for a change that we assumed something as drastically different as that would bring success. We had been trying and failing with previous managers all using a similar formation, and got stuck in a 2 or 3 year cycle of looking for a new manager when things start going wrong. But the system is proving to be Amorim's downfall. He refuses to change it despite the clear issues it is causing, and the agonising lack of players that are capable of playing the system, especially in the two CM positions which demand high energy and physicality. Ironically the United player of recent years that would fit that role best is Scott McTominay.

But some of the main shortcomings seem to be defensive, which is odd, as you would expect the defensive numbers in the shape to offer quite a lot of solidity, or at least a lot of numbers in and around your own area to snuff out danger. We play with five actual defenders on the pitch, three of which are centre backs, and then two defensive midfielders in front of that five. So with 7 players on the pitch with at least half of their role dedicated to defending, it's absolutely mind-blowing how open and easy to play through we are. If feels like the sheer number of defensive players might even be the issue - too many bodies but not enough of them willing to take responsibility, or perhaps not enough players who are sure about whose responsitlity a given situation is.

Amorim had a full pre-season to work on his shape and his system, so there can be no real excuse for players not knowing their jobs by now. This group of players don't - and seemingly won't be able to  - understand this system any time soon. We'll likely be in the Championship before they do.

My biggest frustration is that we actually have a very good squad of players if you take them all individually. These are players who should not be languishing as low as they are in the table. If we reverted to 4-2-3-1 I could put a very good 11 out that should be looking for a top 6 finish comfortably.

It feels crazy to say it, but I am almost pining for the days of Erik ten Hag, when we reached lofty positions as high as 6th and 7th. 2nd place finishes with Ole at the wheel feel like a million miles away right now. Which leads me on to another famous saying - you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone.
