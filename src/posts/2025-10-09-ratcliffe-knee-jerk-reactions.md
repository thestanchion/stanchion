Jim Ratcliffe - United minority owner since 2024 - has given an interview today where he calls for calm and patience, saying that he wants to give Amorim 3 years to prove himself at the club.

> "They want overnight success,” Ratcliffe said. “They think it’s a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it’s all going to be roses tomorrow. You can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.”

Reports are that [the players are fully behind him](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/13447108/ruben-amorim-has-man-utd-squads-support-as-sir-jim-ratcliffe-takes-patient-approach-with-head-coach) and what he is trying to achieve, and certain analysts and content creators are saying that they are starting to see patterns emerging, and that there is evidence of Amorim's plans starting to take shape.

- Is that a reaction to one win? All wanted him out before Sunderland game
- Show of strength from board, not going to bow to public noise etc
- Massive confidence boost for Amorim, hopefully if he is backed further in Jan/summer
- Hoping that this doesn't mean the current form is going to be allowed to carry on for another 2 years before they eventually get rid of him
- Ratcliffe compared him to Arteta and the example we can take from giving a manager time to implement things like Arsenal have
