                <p>There's nothing else on earth that can bring people together, evoke deep-rooted tribal hatred, make someone laugh, make someone cry and amaze you all within one match in the same way that football can.</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll see something so ridiculously incredible that you have no choice but to stop in complete awe of the sheer audacity of the player to even attempt it. Ronaldo from 40 yards against Porto. Andros Townsend's volley against City. Ronaldinho controlling a cross field pass on his back.</p>
<p>And sometimes your team makes you so angry you want to stick the nearest chair through a window. Sometimes a player can't walk one second, and is sprinting after a through-ball the next.</p>
<p>Football makes me so happy and so angry that every now and then I need to just share my thoughts with the world, or more often, have a massive rant.</p>
<p>And that's what The Stanchion is: A place for ranting and raving about football, in whatever form that may be. I don't expect anybody to read anything I write here, but it's here if you fancy it.</p>
<h6>Cheers, Ash</h6>
